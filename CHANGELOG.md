ramsey/http-range provides functionality for parsing HTTP range headers for a
variety of range units. Out-of-the-box, ramsey/http-range supports
[bytes ranges as defined in RFC 7233 ยง 2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-2.1),
as well as basic support for generic
[range units](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-2). The library
provides interfaces, abstract classes, and factories, allowing creation of
[other range units](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-2.2).
